## **Purpose**

The **OCI Load Balancer service** provides:

- **High Availability (HA)**
- **Scalability**
- **Security** (hides backend servers)

It distributes traffic across multiple backend servers (instances) to ensure smooth performance and resilience.

---

## **How It Works**

- Clients send requests to the **Load Balancer (reverse proxy)**.
- The Load Balancer forwards the requests to **multiple backend servers**.
- It checks **backend health** and automatically routes traffic to healthy instances only.

**Result:**

Even if one backend fails → application remains online.

## **Types of Load Balancers in OCI**

### **HTTP (Layer 7) Load Balancer**

- Operates at **OSI Layer 7** (Application Layer).
- Understands **HTTP / HTTPS** traffic.
- Supports **content-based routing** and **SSL features**.

### Shapes

- **Flexible Shape** → You define **min–max bandwidth** (e.g., 10 Mbps to 8 Gbps).
- **Predefined Shape** → Fixed sizes (micro, small, medium, large).
    - Auto scales within its shape.

### Visibility

- **Public Load Balancer**: Accessible from the internet.
- **Private Load Balancer**: Used inside a private VCN (e.g., between web and database tiers).

### Features

- Content-based routing
- SSL termination / passthrough
- High availability (multi–fault domain)
- Autoscaling (with flexible shapes)

---

### **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

- Operates at **Layer 3 & 4** (Network and Transport Layers).
- Supports **TCP, UDP, and ICMP** traffic.
- Focused on **low latency** and **high performance**.
- Can be **public** or **private**, like HTTP LB.

### When to Use

| Requirement | Best Option |
| --- | --- |
| Lowest latency & high throughput | **Network Load Balancer** |
| Application-aware routing & SSL features | **HTTP Load Balancer** |

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- Load Balancers are **reverse proxies** that improve **availability**, **scalability**, and **resilience**.
- **HTTP LB = Smarter routing**, **NLB = Faster performance**.
- Both support **public** and **private** configurations.
- Flexible scaling → adapts automatically to traffic.
- Essential for **multi-tier architectures** (e.g., web → app → DB).
