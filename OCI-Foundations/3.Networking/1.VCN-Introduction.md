## Overview

OCI networking is built around the concept of a **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** — a **private, software-defined network** that you create in Oracle Cloud.

A VCN allows **secure communication** between:

- OCI resources (instances, databases, etc.)
- On-premises environments
- Other OCI regions or VCNs

It is:

- **Regional** (spans the entire region)
- **Highly available**
- **Massively scalable**
- **Secure by design**

## What is a VCN (Virtual Cloud Network)?

A **VCN** is similar to a **traditional data center network**, but virtual.

You control:

- IP address ranges
- Subnets
- Routing rules
- Security lists

Each VCN has an **address space**, defined in **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** notation.

### Example:

```sql
VCN CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
```

You can **subdivide** this address space into **subnets**:

- **Public Subnet** → e.g., 10.0.1.0/24
- **Private Subnet** → e.g., 10.0.2.0/24

**Instances** (like web servers or databases) are launched inside these subnets and receive IP addresses from them.

## Subnets

Subnets are the **building blocks** of your VCN.

- You deploy compute instances and other resources here.
- They define **network boundaries** for communication and security.
- Each subnet is either:
    - **Public:** Has access to the Internet via an Internet Gateway.
    - **Private:** Isolated from the Internet; may use a NAT or Service Gateway for outbound traffic.

## Communication Gateways

OCI offers multiple **gateways and routers** to control traffic in and out of your VCN.

| Gateway | Purpose | Direction | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Connects VCN to the Internet | Bidirectional | Public web servers |
| **NAT Gateway** | Allows outbound Internet traffic from private subnets | Outbound only | Patching or updates from private instances |
| **Service Gateway** | Connects VCN to OCI public services (like Object Storage) **without Internet access** | Internal | Secure access to OCI services |
| **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)** | Connects VCN to **on-premises networks** or **other VCNs** | Private | Hybrid cloud connectivity |

### Example: Communication Scenarios

- **Web Instance (Public Subnet)**
    
    → Internet access via **Internet Gateway**
    
- **Database Instance (Private Subnet)**
    
    → Outbound updates via **NAT Gateway**
    
- **Backup to Object Storage**
    
    → Through **Service Gateway**
    
- **VPN Connection to Data Center**
    
    → Through **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)**

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VCN** | Your private, software-defined network in OCI |
| **CIDR** | Defines the IP address range of the network |
| **Subnet** | Logical subdivision of a VCN (public or private) |
| **Internet Gateway** | Two-way communication between VCN and Internet |
| **NAT Gateway** | Outbound-only Internet access from private subnets |
| **Service Gateway** | Access to OCI public services without Internet |
| **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)** | Connects VCN to on-premises or other VCNs |
