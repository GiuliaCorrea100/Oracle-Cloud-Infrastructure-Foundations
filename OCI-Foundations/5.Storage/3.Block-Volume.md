### **Definition**

OCI **Block Volume** provides **persistent and durable network storage** for compute instances.

- It behaves like a **virtual hard drive** that you can **attach**, **detach**, and **reuse**.
- The data **remains safe** even if the compute instance is **terminated**.

---

### **Core Characteristics**

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Persistent** | Data stays available even after the instance is deleted. |
| **Durable** | Multiple copies are stored within the data center for reliability. |
| **Network-based** | Volumes are not physically attached but accessed over the OCI network. |

---

### **Block Volume Tiers**

OCI offers **four performance tiers**, each optimized for different workloads:

| Tier | Use Case | IOPS/GB (approx.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lower Cost** | Sequential workloads (e.g., streaming, data warehousing) | ~2 IOPS/GB |
| **Balanced** | General workloads, boot disks | ~10–20 IOPS/GB |
| **Higher Performance** | High I/O workloads | ~60 IOPS/GB |
| **Ultra High Performance** | Mission-critical DBs or enterprise workloads | ~225 IOPS/GB |

> You can choose a tier that matches your cost vs performance needs.
>

### **Auto-Tune Performance**

- When a volume is **detached**, OCI automatically changes its tier to **Lower Cost**.
- When it’s **reattached**, OCI restores its **previous performance setting**.
    
    **Purpose:** reduce cost while keeping flexibility.

### **Security & Encryption**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Encryption at Rest** | Data is encrypted while stored on disks. |
| **Encryption in Transit** | Data between the instance and Block Volume is encrypted. |
| **Keys** | Oracle-managed by default, or bring-your-own (Customer-Managed Keys). |
| **Mandatory** | Encryption **cannot be disabled**. |

---

### **Shared Access**

- **Read/Write Shareable Volumes** → multiple compute instances can attach to the **same block volume** and perform **read and write operations** simultaneously.
    
    Useful for **clustered databases** or **shared application storage**.
    

---

### **Resizing Block Volumes**

Two resizing options:

- **Online Resizing** → expand volume **without detaching** (no downtime).
- **Offline Resizing** → expand after detaching (simpler, but requires downtime).

Ideal for scaling storage **while keeping applications running**.

---

### **Replication Across Regions**

- **Asynchronous replication** between regions.
- Use cases:
    - **Disaster Recovery (DR)**
    - **Data Migration**
    - **Geographic Expansion**
- Keeps **copies of your data** available in multiple regions.

---

### **Volume Groups**

- Group multiple block volumes together.
- Enables **time-consistent backups** of applications using multiple disks.
- You can **restore** all related volumes together from a **Volume Group Backup**.

Example:

> A database using 3 volumes (data, logs, temp) can be backed up/restored as one unit.

| Feature | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Persistent & Durable | Keeps data safe beyond instance lifecycle |
| Multiple Performance Tiers | Balance between cost and speed |
| Auto-Tune | Saves money automatically |
| Encryption | Always on (at rest + in transit) |
| Replication | Enables DR and cross-region backups |
| Volume Groups | Simplifies multi-volume management |
