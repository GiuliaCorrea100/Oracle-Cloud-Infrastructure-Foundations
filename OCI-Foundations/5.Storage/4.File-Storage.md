## **OCI File Storage Service (FSS)** – Summary

### **What It Is**

The **File Storage Service** provides **shared, elastic, and fully managed file systems** in the cloud.

It behaves like a **traditional network file system (NFS)** — but accessible across multiple compute instances in OCI.

Think of it as a **shared drive in the cloud** that multiple servers can mount and access simultaneously.

---

### **How It Works**

- Multiple **compute instances** connect (or *mount*) to a **shared file system** using **NFSv3 protocol**.
- All connected instances can **read/write simultaneously** to the same files and directories.
- Files are stored **hierarchically** (folders, subfolders, documents) — just like in Windows or Linux.

Compute Instance B   ---->  [ Shared File System (FSS) ]

### **Key Features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Fully Managed** | OCI handles scaling, availability, and patching. |
| **Shared Access** | Multiple compute instances can mount the same file system. |
| **Elastic Scaling** | Automatically scales up/down based on usage. |
| **Standard Protocols** | Supports **NFSv3** (Network File System). |
| **Snapshots** | Point-in-time backups of file systems (quick restore after deletion or corruption). |
| **High Durability** | Data is automatically replicated within the AD. |
| **Security** | Encryption both **at rest** and **in transit**. |
| **Access Control** | Managed through **export options**, **VNIC subnet rules**, and **IAM policies**. |

---

### **Security**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **At Rest Encryption** | Data stored on disk is automatically encrypted. |
| **In Transit Encryption** | Data is encrypted while traveling between compute instances and the file system. |
| **Access Control** | Based on subnet and IP rules in export options, plus IAM permissions. |

---

### **Snapshots**

- Snapshots are **read-only, point-in-time backups** of the file system.
- Useful for:
    - Recovery from accidental deletions
    - Versioning or cloning environments
        
        You can create new file systems **from snapshots** for quick restore.

### **Common Use Cases**

| Use Case | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enterprise Applications** | Shared file storage for systems like **Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS)**. |
| **Corporate File Shares** | Shared directories across teams (like network drives). |
| **Microservices/Containers** | Persistent shared storage for stateful workloads. |
| **Analytics / HPC** | Scale-out compute jobs needing shared data access. |
| **General Purpose File System** | Any workload needing hierarchical file access. |

---

### **Typical Workflow**

1. **Create** a File System in OCI Console.
2. **Configure export options** (network rules for who can mount it).
3. **Mount** it on one or more compute instances (via NFSv3).
4. **Use** it like a normal directory (read/write files).
5. **Backup** with **snapshots** as needed.

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **File Storage = Shared Folder in Cloud** | Multiple compute instances access the same files. |
| **Protocol** | Uses **NFSv3** for communication. |
| **Snapshots** | Built-in backup and recovery mechanism. |
| **Security** | Encryption at rest & in transit enabled by default. |
| **Use Cases** | Ideal for enterprise apps, shared folders, microservices, HPC. |
