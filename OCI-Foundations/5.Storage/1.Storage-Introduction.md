### **First: Understand Storage Requirements**

Before choosing a storage service, consider:

- **Persistence:** Do you need the data to remain after reboot or instance deletion?
- **Durability:** How many copies of the data do you want (replication for fault tolerance)?
- **Performance:** Required IOPS and throughput.
- **Capacity:** How much space do you need?
- **Connectivity:** Local vs. network-attached.
- **Protocol:** How your app will access data (block, file, or HTTP).

## **Main OCI Storage Types**

| Storage Type | Description | Use Case | Persistence | Access Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Local NVMe** | High-performance SSDs *physically attached* to the compute instance | Performance-critical apps (DBs, caching, temp storage) | ❌ Non-persistent (data lost if instance terminated) | Local |
| **Block Volume** | Network-attached storage managed as fixed-size blocks | Databases, boot volumes, enterprise workloads | ✅ Persistent | Network |
| **File Storage** | Shared network file system (NFS-based) | Shared storage between multiple compute instances | ✅ Persistent | Network |
| **Object Storage** | Internet-scale storage for unstructured data (accessed via HTTP APIs) | Backups, logs, videos, photos, big data | ✅ Highly durable and scalable | HTTP (REST API) |

## **Data Migration Tools**

Used to transfer data *to OCI*:

- **Data Transfer Disk:** Send physical disks for upload.
- **Data Transfer Appliance:** Large device for bulk transfers.

## **Quick Analogy**

- **Local NVMe →** Fast but temporary (like your computer’s RAM disk).
- **Block Volume →** A virtual hard drive.
- **File Storage →** A shared network folder.
- **Object Storage →** A cloud drive (like Google Drive or S3).
