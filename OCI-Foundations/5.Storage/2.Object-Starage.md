### **What It Is**

An **internet-scale, high-performance, durable storage service** that manages data as **objects** (ideal for unstructured data).

- **Type of data:** logs, videos, images, text files, backups, etc.
- **Scope:** Regional service (data replicated across Availability Domains).
- **Access:** Public by default, but can be configured for **private access**.
- **Architecture:** Serverless and highly durable.

### **Core Concepts**

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Object** | The actual data (e.g., file). It has a **name (key)** and **value (content)**, plus **metadata**. |
| **Bucket** | Container that holds objects. Each bucket has a **unique name within a tenancy**. |
| **Namespace** | Top-level logical container for all buckets and objects within a tenancy (unique across OCI). |
| **Flat Hierarchy** | There are **no real folders**—any folder structure is simulated with **prefixes**. |
| **API Endpoint Example** | `https://objectstorage.<region>.oraclecloud.com/n/<namespace>/b/<bucket>/o/<object>` |

### **Storage Tiers**

| Tier | Purpose | Cost | Retrieval | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard (Hot)** | Frequently accessed data | Highest | Instant | Strongly consistent |
| **Infrequent Access (IA)** | Long-term but occasionally accessed data | ~60% cheaper | Retrieval fee | Minimum storage: 31 days |
| **Archive** | Rarely accessed, long-term data (cold storage) | Lowest | Requires restore (≈1h) | Minimum storage: 90 days |

### **Advanced Features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Auto-Tiering** | Automatically moves data between Standard and IA tiers based on access frequency — no retrieval or pro-rated fees. |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Automates data transitions between tiers or deletion after defined periods (e.g., *Move to archive after 30 days; delete after 180 days*). |
| **Versioning** | Keeps multiple versions of objects automatically if enabled. |
| **Encryption** | Enabled by default; you can also **bring your own keys (BYOK)**. |
| **Access Methods** | Via **HTTP APIs** using familiar verbs: `PUT`, `GET`, `DELETE`, etc. |

### **Typical Use Cases**

- Backup and restore
- Archiving old data
- Big data and analytics repositories
- Log and event storage
- Media storage and delivery (photos, videos)
- Hosting static web content

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Regional and durable**: replicated across ADs.
- **Scalable**: store unlimited objects.
- **Flexible tiers** reduce cost based on access frequency.
- **Fully managed and encrypted by default**.
- **API-based access** makes it ideal for cloud-native and web-scale apps.
