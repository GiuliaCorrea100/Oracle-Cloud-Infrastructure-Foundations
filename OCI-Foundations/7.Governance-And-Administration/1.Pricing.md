OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) offers pricing that aims to be **simple, transparent, and cheaper** than most competitors. There are **3 main pricing models** you should remember:

### 1) **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)**

- You **only pay for what you use**.
- No upfront payment.
- No minimum time commitment.
- Usage is metered.
- **Example:** VMs running (you pay as long as they are ON).

### 2) **Consumption-Based Pricing** *(for some services like Functions)*

- You are charged **only when the service is actually executed**.
- If nothing runs → **you pay nothing**.

This is **different from PAYG**, because with PAYG a VM can be idle but still costs money.

With Functions, if it doesn’t run, you spend **zero**.

### 3) **Annual (or Monthly) Universal Credits**

- A company commits to spend **a fixed amount per year**.
- In exchange, they receive **discounted prices**.
- Credits must be used within **12 months**.
- If usage exceeds credit → extra is charged as PAYG.
- **Bigger commitments = bigger discounts**.

### 4) **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**

- If a customer **already owns Oracle software licenses** on-premises,
    
    they can **reuse** them in OCI.
    
- Benefit: **reduces total cloud cost**.

## **What Affects Pricing?**

| Factor | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Resource Size** | Larger compute shapes, bigger DBs = higher cost. |
| **Resource Type** | VM vs Bare Metal vs Serverless, each priced differently. |
| **Data Transfer** | One of the largest cost factors. |
| **Licensing** | Costs vary if using BYOL or OCI-provided licenses. |

---

## **Same Price Everywhere**

OCI pricing is **the same in every region worldwide**.

This is **different** from many other cloud providers that charge different prices in different countries/regions.

---

## **Data Transfer Costs**

Data transfer can be a **big part of the bill**, especially in distributed apps.

Oracle provides key **cost advantages**:

| Transfer Type | Cost in OCI |
| --- | --- |
| **Between Availability Domains (ADs)** | **Free** (no cross-zone charges) |
| **Inbound traffic (into OCI)** | **Free** |
| **Outbound traffic (leaving OCI)** | **Up to 10× cheaper** than other cloud providers |

This means **high-availability architectures are NOT penalized** in OCI.

| Concept | Quick Memory Cue |
| --- | --- |
| Pricing Models | PAYG, Universal Credits, BYOL |
| Functions Pricing | Charged only when executed |
| Same Pricing Everywhere | No region-based price surprises |
| Data Transfer | Free between ADs + outbound much cheaper |

---

**OCI pricing is transparent, globally consistent, supports PAYG and Universal Credits, and offers significantly lower data transfer costs.**
