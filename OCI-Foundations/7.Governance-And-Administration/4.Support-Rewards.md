## **Oracle Support Rewards (OSR)**

**Purpose:**

Oracle Support Rewards allows customers who **consume OCI services** to **reduce the cost of their Oracle on-premises software license support**.

---

## How It Works

- For every **$1 spent on OCI**, customers **earn credits** that can be applied to reduce **on-premises support fees**.
- Rewards are earned **automatically based on monthly OCI usage**.

| Customer Type | Savings Earned |
| --- | --- |
| **Standard Oracle Customer** | **$0.25** reward for every **$1** spent on OCI |
| **ULA Customer** (Unlimited License Agreement) | **$0.33** reward for every **$1** spent on OCI |

So:

- The **more OCI consumption**, the **greater the reduction** in support costs.
- Support cost can be **reduced to zero** in some cases.

## **Example Calculation**

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| On-prem Support Cost | **$450/month** |
| Monthly OCI Consumption | **$1,000/month** |

**If ULA Customer:**

Reward = $1,000 × 0.33 = **$330** → New Support Cost = $450 − $330 = **$120**

**If Non-ULA Customer:**

Reward = $1,000 × 0.25 = **$250** → New Support Cost = $450 − $250 = **$200**

---

## What OCI Usage Counts?

- Nearly **all OCI services** qualify (Compute, Storage, Databases including Autonomous DB, etc.).
- Rewards are calculated as:

```
(Unit net price of consumed service) × (Actual Monthly Usage)
```

---

## Managing Rewards

- Rewards **accrue automatically**.
- You can **view and redeem** Support Rewards in the **OCI Console** under:

```
Billing & Cost Management → Support Rewards
```

---

- OSR reduces **on-premises Oracle support costs** based on **OCI usage**.
- Earn:
    - **$0.25 per $1 OCI spend** (normal customer)
    - **$0.33 per $1 OCI spend** (ULA customer)
- Can **reduce support fees to zero**.
- Rewards are **visible and redeemable in OCI Console**.
