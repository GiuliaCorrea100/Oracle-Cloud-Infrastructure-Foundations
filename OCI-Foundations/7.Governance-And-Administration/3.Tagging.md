**Tags** are **key–value pairs** used to **organize, manage, and control** resources in OCI.

You apply tags to resources such as compute instances, storage volumes, networks, etc.

Example:

```
environment = production
project = alpha
```

Tags help you **identify and group** resources when your environment grows to hundreds or thousands of cloud objects.

## **Why Tag? (Main Use Cases)**

| Use Case | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Resource Organization** | Helps classify resources by environment, project, owner, or purpose. |
| **Cost Management** | You can group tagged resources and **see cost per project, per department, or per application**. Very useful in pay-as-you-go environments. |
| **Tag-Based Access Control** | IAM Policies can **grant or restrict access based on tags**, not just compartments/groups. This adds flexibility and security. |

## **Types of Tags in OCI**

### 1) **Free-Form Tags**

- Simple **key-value** pairs.
- **No enforced structure**, no validation.
- Example:

```
environment = production
```

- Easy to use, but can become inconsistent across teams if not governed.

### 2) **Defined Tags** (More powerful, governed)

- Tags are defined **inside a Tag Namespace**.
- Example:

```
Namespace: operations
Key: environment
Value: production
```

- Benefits:
    - **Enforced structure** (schema consistency).
    - You can **control who is allowed to use these tags** by IAM **policies**.
    - You can **restrict allowed values** (e.g., only `dev`, `test`, `stage`, `prod`).

### Key Concepts:

| Concept | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Tag Namespace** | A container for a group of tags. |
| **Tag Key Definition** | Defines the tag’s name and allowed value type(s). |
| **Value Rules** | Can enforce allowed values or allow any string. |

---

### Important Notes

- **Tag namespaces cannot be deleted**, but they **can be retired** (no longer used).
    
    This is for **governance and audit history**.
