OCI provides several built-in tools to help you **monitor, control, and optimize** cloud spending.

### 1) **Budgets**

- Used to **track and control costs** in a tenancy or compartment.
- You **create a budget** (e.g., $100/month or $1,000/month).
- You can **set up alerts** to notify you when:
    - Spending is **forecasted** to exceed the budget, or
    - Spending **already exceeds** a limit.
- Helps **prevent unexpected charges**.

---

### 2) **Cost Analysis**

- A visualization tool to **review past spending**.
- Helps identify:
    - Trends
    - Cost spikes
    - Which services or compartments consume the most resources
- Allows better planning and optimization going forward.

---

### 3) **Usage Reports**

- **Daily-generated CSV files** containing **detailed usage and cost data**.
- Stored automatically in **Object Storage** bucket.
- Can be accessed **across tenancies** using cross-tenancy policies (useful for large organizations).
- Commonly used for:
    - Billing reconciliation
    - Finance reports
    - Custom dashboards

---

### 4) **Service Limits**

- OCI includes **default limits** (e.g., number of VMs, block volumes, load balancers).
- Purpose: **Prevent misuse or accidental excessive usage.**
- If needed, you can **request additional capacity** through support.
- The **Service Limits dashboard** shows:
    - Current limits
    - Current usage
    - Limits per region/availability domain

---

### 5) **Quotas**

- A **more fine-grained control** than service limits.
- Allows you to **control how many resources** can be created **in a specific compartment**.
- Example quota policies:
    - `max 10 instances in compartment <X>`
    - `zero exadata in compartment <Y>`
- Useful for:
    - **Cost control**
    - **Project resource isolation**
    - **Preventing accidental large resource deployments**
