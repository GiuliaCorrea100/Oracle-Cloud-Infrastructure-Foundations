### Containers vs Virtual Machines

| Feature | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Containers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structure** | Each VM runs its own OS, libraries, and app on top of a hypervisor. | Containers share the host OS but have their own libraries and app. |
| **Overhead** | Heavy — multiple OS instances cause high resource usage. | Lightweight — no OS duplication. |
| **Size** | Usually **GBs** in size. | Usually **MBs** in size. |
| **Boot Time** | Takes **minutes**. | Takes **seconds**. |
| **Portability** | Limited (depends on OS/hypervisor). | **Highly portable** — same container runs anywhere. |

**Main advantage of containers:**

They’re **lightweight, fast, and portable**, making them ideal for **cloud-native and microservices** applications.

### What Is Container Orchestration?

After you containerize your apps, they need:

- Networking
- Scaling (up/down)
- Health checks
- Deployment automation

**Container orchestration** automates all that.

**Kubernetes** is the leading open-source tool for container orchestration.

### What Is OKE?

**Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)** is:

- A **fully managed**, **scalable**, and **highly available** Kubernetes service.
- Based on **open-source Kubernetes**.
- Integrated with OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure).

OKE gives developers:

- **One-click cluster creation**
- **CLI / API support**
- **Support for Arm- and GPU-based instances**
- **Automatic scaling, upgrades, and self-healing**

---

### How It Works (OKE Architecture)

OKE is built around two main parts:

### **a) Control Plane**

- Manages cluster operations (scheduling, scaling, health, etc.).
- Includes components like:
    - **API Server**
    - **Controller Manager**
    - **etcd** (key-value database)
- **Managed by Oracle** — no charge to the customer.

### **b) Worker Nodes**

- Run your **containers (pods)**.
- Grouped into **node pools**.
- **Managed by the customer** (you control configuration, scaling, etc.).

---

### Key Concepts

- **Node:** A VM that runs Kubernetes and hosts containers.
- **Node Pool:** A group of nodes with the same configuration.
- **Pod:** The smallest unit in Kubernetes — one or more containers that share resources.
- **Cluster:** A group of worker nodes + a control plane.

### Cluster Types

| Type | Description | SLA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Enhanced Cluster** | Supports all features, including advanced and virtual nodes. | Financially backed SLA |
| **Basic Cluster** | Core Kubernetes functionality only. | Service Level Objective (SLO) only |

---

### Node Types

| Node Type | Description | Available In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Virtual Nodes** | Serverless — Oracle handles patching, upgrades, and capacity. | Only in **Enhanced Clusters** |
| **Managed Nodes** | You manage the OS, Kubernetes version, and scaling. | In **Basic** and **Enhanced Clusters** |

**Choose Virtual Nodes** → if you want a **hands-off**, fully managed experience.

**Choose Managed Nodes** → if you want **full control and flexibility**.

---

- Containers are lighter and faster than VMs.
- Kubernetes orchestrates containerized apps.
- **OKE = Kubernetes managed by Oracle Cloud**.
- You manage your **worker nodes**, Oracle manages the **control plane**.
- Choose between **Enhanced** or **Basic** clusters, and **Virtual** or **Managed** nodes depending on your needs.
