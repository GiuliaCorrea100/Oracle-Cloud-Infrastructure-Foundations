## **Definition**

The **OCI Compute Service** provides:

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**
- **Bare Metal Servers**
    
    to run your applications in the cloud with:
    
    1. **Scalability**
    2. **High Performance**
    3. **Lower Pricing**

## **Scalability — Flexible Shapes**

### Concept:

**Flexible Shapes** let you **customize your VM’s CPU and memory** — unlike fixed, “t-shirt sized” options (small, medium, large).

- You can **choose**:
    - Number of **OCPUs (cores)**
    - Amount of **memory (RAM)**
- Thousands of combinations available.

**Benefit:** No need to over- or under-provision resources — you scale precisely to your app’s needs.

## **Compute Options**

| Type | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Virtual Machine (VM)** | Shared physical host (multi-tenant) | General workloads |
| **Bare Metal Server** | Full physical server — no sharing | High performance, full control |
| **Dedicated Host** | A physical host reserved for you — but allows **your own VMs** | Security-sensitive workloads |

Even shared VMs have **strong isolation**, so your environment stays secure.

## **Processor Choices**

OCI offers **multiple CPU architectures**, giving flexibility in performance and cost:

| Processor | Example Family | Ideal For | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AMD** | EPYC | Balanced workloads | Great price-performance |
| **Intel** | Xeon | Traditional enterprise apps | Broad compatibility |
| **ARM (Ampere A1)** | Ampere Altra | Cloud-native, mobile, API workloads | **Up to 69% better performance** vs Intel in Nginx benchmark |

*Example:*

In Nginx reverse proxy tests, ARM-based **Ampere A1** showed:

- **+32% better price-performance** vs AMD
- **+69% better performance** vs Intel

## **Pricing and Cost Optimization**

### Pay-As-You-Go

- Pay only for what you use.
- OCI Compute is **~50% cheaper** than major competitors.

### Preemptible VMs

- Short-lived, **low-cost VMs** (can be stopped anytime).
- Ideal for **batch jobs** and **fault-tolerant workloads**.
- **~50% cheaper** than regular VMs.
