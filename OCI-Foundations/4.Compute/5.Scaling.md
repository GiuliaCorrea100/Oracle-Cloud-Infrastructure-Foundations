### What is Scaling?

Scaling means **changing computing capacity** (CPU, memory, or number of instances) based on your needs.

There are **two types of scaling** in OCI:

---

### **1. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up / Scale Down)**

- **Definition:** Changing the **size or shape** of an instance — increasing or decreasing CPU cores and memory.
- **Example:** Upgrading a VM from 2 OCPUs → 4 OCPUs.
- **Characteristics:**
    - You scale the *same* instance up or down.
    - **Downtime is required** — because OCI has to move your instance to another host.
    - **Best practice:** Stop your instance before scaling it vertically.
- **Used for:** When a single machine needs more power (e.g., a database server or high-load application).

---

### **2. Horizontal Scaling (Autoscaling)**

- **Also called:** Autoscaling.
- **Definition:** Adding or removing **multiple instances (VMs)** of the same shape automatically.
- **Purpose:** Adjust capacity dynamically and improve **high availability**.

### Two directions:

- **Scale out:** Add more VMs when demand increases.
- **Scale in:** Remove VMs when demand decreases.

### Benefits:

- Handles **traffic spikes** automatically (e.g., webstore with sudden visitors).
- Provides **high availability** (if one VM fails, others keep running).
- **No extra cost** to enable Autoscaling — you only pay for the instances in use.

### **How Autoscaling Works in OCI**

There are **3 simple steps**:

### 1 - Create a Configuration (Template)

- Based on an existing instance.
- Defines:
    - OS image
    - Metadata
    - Shape and size
    - Storage and networking setup
- Think of it as a “blueprint” or “stamp” of your instance.

### 2 - Create an Instance Pool

- A **group of identical instances** created from the configuration.
- Can be managed as one unit (start, stop, terminate all together).
- Can spread instances across **different Availability Domains** for **high availability**.

### 3 - Define Autoscaling Rules

- Attach Autoscaling rules to the instance pool.
- Rules include:
    - **Initial (desired) size**
    - **Minimum** and **maximum** size
    - **Conditions** (for CPU or memory thresholds)

### Example Rule:

- Start with 2 instances
- If CPU > 70% → add 2 more
- If CPU < 40% → remove 2

So the system **monitors performance continuously** and adjusts the number of running instances automatically.

| Type | Description | Downtime | Used for | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vertical Scaling** | Increase or decrease CPU/memory of one instance | Yes | Single-server apps | From 2 → 4 OCPUs |
| **Horizontal Scaling (Autoscaling)** | Add or remove multiple instances automatically |  No | Web apps, scalable workloads | 2 → 4 VMs when traffic grows |
