### **Compute Instances**

- A **compute instance** in OCI is a **virtual machine (VM)** or **bare metal server** that runs inside your **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**.
- Each instance runs on a **shape** (defines CPU, memory, and hardware type) and an **image** (the OS, such as Oracle Linux, Ubuntu, or Windows).

---

### **Networking Setup**

To make an instance accessible (for example, for a web server), you need:

- **VCN (Virtual Cloud Network):** The main private network.
- **Subnet:** A smaller network segment inside the VCN — can be **public** (has internet access) or **private**.
- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Connects the subnet to the internet.
- **Route Table:** Contains rules that direct traffic to the internet gateway.
- **Security List:** Controls inbound and outbound traffic using firewall rules.

Example rules:

- Allow **port 22 (SSH)** → to connect remotely.
- Allow **port 80 (HTTP)** → to host a web server.

### **Instance Creation**

- You can create an instance manually or using a **wizard** (automated setup).
- When creating manually, you must:
    - Choose **region** and **availability domain (AD)**.
    - Choose **shape** (e.g., flexible VM with custom CPU/memory).
    - Choose **image** (the OS).
    - Choose **network** (attach to the public subnet).
    - Add your **SSH public key** for secure access.

---

### **SSH Access**

- SSH (Secure Shell) allows you to connect securely to your instance.
- You use your **private key** locally and paste your **public key** into the instance settings.
- Example command:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i demo-key opc@<public_ip_address>
    
    ```
    

---

### **Apache Web Server Installation**

- After connecting via SSH, you can install a web server (like Apache).
- Because the instance is in a **public subnet** with an internet gateway, it can:
    - Access the internet.
    - Be accessed publicly through its **public IP address**.

When you open the instance’s public IP in a browser, you’ll see the web page served by Apache.

In this demo, the instructor:

1. Created a **VCN**, **public subnet**, and **internet gateway**.
2. Configured **route table** and **security list** for internet and HTTP access.
3. Created a **compute instance** with a **flex shape** and **Oracle Linux image**.
4. Added **SSH keys** for secure login.
5. Installed **Apache web server** and accessed it through the instance’s **public IP**.
