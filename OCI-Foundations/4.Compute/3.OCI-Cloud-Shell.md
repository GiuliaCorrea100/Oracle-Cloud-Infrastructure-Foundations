### **What is OCI Cloud Shell?**

OCI Cloud Shell is a **small, Linux-based virtual machine** that you can access directly from your **Oracle Cloud Console**, through your web browser.

Think of it like a built-in terminal in the cloud — no need to install anything on your computer.

It comes preloaded with tools such as:

- **OCI CLI** (already authenticated to your account)
- **Git**, **Java**, **Python**, and other developer utilities

This makes it a convenient environment for performing quick administrative or development tasks.

### **How SSH Keys Work**

- The **public key** is copied to the **remote server** (for example, your OCI compute instance).
- The **private key** stays securely with you.
- When you try to connect, the system matches them — like a lock (public key) and key (private key).
    
    Only the correct private key can unlock access.
