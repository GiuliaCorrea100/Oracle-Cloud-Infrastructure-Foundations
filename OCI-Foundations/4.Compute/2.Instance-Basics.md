## **What Is an Instance?**

An **instance** = a **compute host** in OCI.

It can be a **Virtual Machine (VM)** or a **Bare Metal** instance.

Each instance depends on several **OCI components** to function properly.

---

## **Dependencies of a Compute Instance**

### **a. Region and Availability Domain (AD)**

- **Region** = geographical location (e.g., Toronto, São Paulo).
- **Availability Domain (AD)** = independent **data center** within a region.
- OCI regions have **multiple ADs** for redundancy and fault tolerance.

---

### **b. Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**

- **Required before** creating an instance.
- A VCN is divided into **subnets** (public or private).
- Each instance is connected to a subnet through a **Virtual NIC (VNIC)**.

### Network Setup:

- Physical NIC (in host) → **Virtualized** → creates a **VNIC**.
- The **VNIC** lives inside a **subnet**, which provides:
    - **Private IP** (always assigned)
    - **Optional Public IP**

**Dependency #1:** Networking (VCN, Subnets, VNIC)

### **Boot Volume and Block Volumes**

Each instance depends on **OCI Block Volume Service** for storage.

| Type | Purpose | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Boot Volume** | Contains OS image | Network storage |
| **Block Volume** | Data disks, app files | Network storage |

These disks are **not local** — they’re stored **remotely** on OCI network storage, ensuring persistence and reliability.

**Dependency #2:** Storage (Block Volume Service)

---

## **Images**

When launching an instance, you choose an **image** that defines:

- The **Operating System (OS)** (e.g., Oracle Linux, Ubuntu, Windows)
- Optional **preinstalled software**

*The image determines the contents of your boot volume.*

---

## **Control Plane Dependencies**

| Layer | Service | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Compute Control Plane** | Manages instances | Creation, scaling, monitoring |
| **Networking Control Plane** | Manages VCN, subnets, IPs | Provides connectivity |
| **Block Storage Control Plane** | Manages disks | Provides OS and data storage |

Compute relies on both **networking** and **storage** planes.

---

## **Live Migration**

### Purpose:

Ensures **high availability** — your VMs keep running during:

- Hardware failures
- Maintenance events

### How It Works:

If a physical host fails, OCI **automatically migrates** your VM to another healthy host **without rebooting**.

You can choose:

- **Opt-in** (enable live migration)
- **Opt-out** (manual restarts only)

*This feature minimizes downtime — almost impossible to replicate easily on-premises.*

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Instance** | VM or Bare Metal Compute Host |
| **VCN/Subnet/VNIC** | Provide network connectivity |
| **Boot Volume** | Stores OS image |
| **Block Volume** | Stores user data |
| **Live Migration** | Keeps VMs running during host failures |
| **Dependencies** | Networking + Block Storage |
