**Encryption & Decryption**

- **Encryption** converts **plaintext** into **ciphertext** (unreadable random-looking data).
- **Decryption** converts **ciphertext** back into **plaintext**.
- Both operations require a **cryptographic key** tied to a **specific algorithm**.

---

### **Keys**

- A **key** is a string (numbers/letters) used by an encryption algorithm to encrypt or decrypt data.
- A **key pair** (used in asymmetric encryption) includes:
    - **Public Key** (shared)
    - **Private Key** (kept secret)

### **Encryption at Rest vs Encryption in Transit**

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Encryption at Rest** | Encrypts data stored on disk/storage. Without keys, data remains unreadable. | Database storage, block volumes, object storage |
| **Encryption in Transit** | Encrypts data moving over networks. Protects against interception. | **HTTPS** communication between client ↔ server |

---

## **Two Types of Encryption**

### **A. Symmetric Encryption**

- **One key** is used for **both encryption and decryption**.
- Both parties must share the **same secret key**.
- **Example Algorithm:** **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard)
    - Key sizes: **128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit**
    - **Fast**, **efficient**, but requires secure key-sharing.

**Flow:**

Sender encrypts with key → Receiver decrypts with the same key

### **B. Asymmetric Encryption**

- Uses **two different keys**:
    - **Public Key** → Encrypts data (shared openly)
    - **Private Key** → Decrypts data (kept secret)
- Harder to break because decrypting requires the private key.

**Example Algorithm:** **RSA**

- Public key = encrypt
- Private key = decrypt
- **More secure** key exchange, but **slower** and more computationally heavy.

## **Algorithms Summary**

| Algorithm | Type | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AES** | Symmetric | Encrypt/Decrypt data | Fast, robust, same key used both ways |
| **RSA** | Asymmetric | Encrypt/Decrypt | Public key encrypts, private key decrypts, slower |
| **ECDSA** | Public Key (Elliptic Curve) | **Digital signatures**, not general encryption | Smaller key sizes, used for signing/authentication |

## **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**

- A **physical cryptographic device** that protects and manages encryption keys.
- Used to perform:
    - Encryption / Decryption
    - Key storage and protection
    - Digital signing
    - Strong authentication
- Must meet **security certifications** (e.g., **FIPS 140** standards).
- If tampering is detected → **keys are automatically destroyed**.

### **In OCI**

- The **OCI Vault** service **uses HSMs**.
- HSMs used by OCI Vault are **FIPS 140-2 Level 3** certified (high security).
- Ensures:
    - Tamper-resistance
    - Identity-based control
    - Regulatory compliance-level security

---

- **Symmetric = one key** (fast, AES).
- **Asymmetric = key pair** (secure distribution, RSA).
- **Encryption at rest** protects stored data.
- **Encryption in transit** protects data flowing over networks.
- **OCI Vault uses certified HSMs** to securely store and manage keys.
