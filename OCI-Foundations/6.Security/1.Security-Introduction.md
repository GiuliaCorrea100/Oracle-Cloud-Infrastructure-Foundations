## **Overview**

### **1. Shared Security Model**

| Responsibility | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Oracle (Security *of* the Cloud)** | Oracle secures the underlying **infrastructure**, including physical data centers, hardware, networking, and the **virtualization layer**. |
| **Customer (Security *in* the Cloud)** | You secure your **data**, **applications**, **endpoints**, and **user access**. You’re also responsible for OS patching and IAM configuration. |

*Think:*

- Oracle → the foundation (hardware, DC, hypervisors)
- You → what runs *on top* (VMs, apps, configs, access)

---

### **Defense in Depth (Layered Security)**

OCI uses a **multi-layered security model** — protecting each layer from **infrastructure → identity → workloads → data → monitoring**.

---

## **Security Layers and Services**

| Layer | Purpose | Example OCI Services |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Detection & Remediation** | Detect misconfigurations and automatically fix them. | Cloud Guard, Security Zones, Threat Intelligence, Vulnerability Scanning |
| **Data Protection** | Encrypt, store, and manage secrets & keys. | Vault (Keys), Vault Secrets, Data Safe, Certificates |
| **OS and Workload Protection** | Secure compute instances, patch OS, isolate workloads. | Shielded Instances, Dedicated Host, OS Management, Bastion |
| **Identity and Access Management** | Manage *who* can access *what*. | IAM, MFA, Federation, Audit |
| **Infrastructure Protection** | Protect the network & apps from attacks. | DDoS Protection, Network Firewall, Security Lists/NSG, WAF |

---

### **Examples of Key Services**

| Service | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Cloud Guard** | Monitors OCI environment for misconfigurations or risky activity and can automatically remediate issues. |
| **Security Zones** | Enforces strict security policies (e.g., “no public bucket access”). |
| **Vault** | Manages **encryption keys** and **secrets** (passwords, API keys). |
| **Data Safe** | Monitors and protects **database security posture**. |
| **OS Management** | Manages **OS patches** and updates across instances. |
| **Bastion** | Provides secure, temporary access to private compute instances. |
| **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** | Protects applications from **Layer 7 attacks** (SQL injection, XSS). |
| **Network Firewall / NSG** | Filters and controls network traffic. |
| **IAM / MFA** | Controls user authentication and enforces multi-factor security. |

---

### **Real Example**

In a typical OCI environment, you might have:

- **Network protection:** via NSG + WAF
- **Access control:** via IAM + MFA
- **Key management:** via Vault
- **Monitoring:** via Cloud Guard + Vulnerability Scanning
- **Secure access:** via Bastion

Together, these provide **complete layered protection** — from physical to application level.
