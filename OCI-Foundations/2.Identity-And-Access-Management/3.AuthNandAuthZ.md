## What is a Principal?

A **Principal** is any IAM entity **allowed to interact with OCI resources**.

There are **two main types** of principals:

### User Principals

- Represent **people** who log into the **OCI Console**, **CLI**, or **SDKs**.
- Example: *Cloud admin logging in to manage compute instances.*

### Resource Principals

- Represent **OCI resources** (like instances) that can **call OCI APIs**.
- Example: *An OCI compute instance (Instance Principal)* making API calls to **Object Storage**.

### Groups

- **Collections of users** with similar access needs.
- Example:
    - *Storage Admin Group* → manage storage resources.
    - *Network Admin Group* → manage VCNs, subnets, gateways.

## Authentication (AuthN)

**Authentication = “Who are you?”**

It verifies *identity*.

### Main Authentication Methods in OCI

| Method | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Username & Password** | Standard console login for human users. | Logging into OCI console. |
| **2. API Signing Keys** | Used for programmatic access (CLI/SDK). Uses RSA key pairs (public/private). | Developer signing API requests with a private key. |
| **3. Authentication Tokens** | Oracle-generated token strings used for 3rd-party apps that don’t support OCI’s native auth. | Using a token for an external app connecting to Autonomous Database. |

**Summary:**

- **Human authentication:** via credentials (username/password).
- **Programmatic authentication:** via keys or tokens.

## Authorization (AuthZ)

**Authorization = “What can you do?”**

Determines *permissions* using **policies**.

### IAM Policies

- Define **who** (groups) can **do what** (verbs) on **which resources** and **where** (location).
- Written in **human-readable language**.

---

### Policy Basics

**Default:** Everything is **denied** unless **explicitly allowed**.

So all policies begin with **`ALLOW`**.

**Policy Syntax:**

```sql
Allow <group-name> to <verb> <resource-type> in <location>
```

**Example**:

```sql
Allow group StorageAdmins to manage buckets in compartment Storage
```

- **Group:** Who → e.g., *StorageAdmins*
- **Verb:** Action → e.g., *manage, use, read, inspect*
- **Resource-type:** What → e.g., *buckets, instances, all-resources*
- **Location:** Where → *tenancy* or *specific compartment*

---

### Verbs (Permission Levels)

| Verb | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **manage** | Full control (create, update, delete, etc.) | “manage all-resources” |
| **use** | Read + limited actions (start/stop instance) | “use instances” |
| **read** | View details only | “read buckets” |
| **inspect** | Only list metadata | “inspect instances” |

---

### Scope

- **Tenancy-level policy:** Applies to *all compartments* and resources.
- **Compartment-level policy:** Applies only to *resources inside that compartment*.

---

### Policy Examples

**Example 1 – Basic admin:**

```sql
Allow group Admins to manage all-resources in tenancy
```

**Example 2 – Scoped access:**

```sql
Allow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family in compartment Networ
```

**Example 3 – Read-only:**

```sql
Allow group Auditors to read all-resources in tenancy

```

---

- **AuthN** confirms identity (who).
- **AuthZ** defines permissions (what).
- OCI uses **principals**, **groups**, and **policies** to enforce secure, fine-grained access.
- Everything is **denied by default** — policies explicitly **allow** access.
