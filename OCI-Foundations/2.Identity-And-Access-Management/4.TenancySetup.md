## Overview

Your **tenancy** is your top-level OCI account — it represents your organization and contains all resources.

Setting up your tenancy properly ensures **security**, **organization**, and **governance** from day one.

---

## Key Roles

### **Tenancy Administrator**

- The person who **creates the account** and manages the overall tenancy.
- Has **full access** to all resources.

### **OCI Administrator (Best Practice)**

- A group of users responsible for **day-to-day management**.
- Operates under specific **policies and compartments**, not using the root tenancy admin account directly.

Typically grouped into something like:

```sql
Group: OCI-Admins
```

## Best Practices for Tenancy Setup

### **1. Avoid using the Tenancy Administrator for daily operations**

- The tenancy admin should only be used for **initial setup and recovery tasks**.
- Instead, create a **dedicated group of administrators (OCI Admins)** with appropriate permissions.

---

### **2. Use Dedicated Compartments**

- Create **separate compartments** to isolate environments or projects, such as:
    - **Production**
    - **Development**
    - **Sandbox**
    - **By Business Unit**
    - **By Region (e.g., North America, Europe)**

**Why?**

- Enhances **security isolation** and **access management**.
- Simplifies **budgeting** and **resource tracking**.
- Keeps the **root compartment empty** — only used for governance-level policies.

**Remember:**

Compartments are **global** (available across all OCI regions).

---

### **3. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- Adds a second layer of protection.
- Requires:
    - Something the user **knows** (password)
    - Something the user **has** (device/app token)
- Reduces risk of unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.

---

## Required Policies for OCI Admins

To delegate daily operations to your **OCI Admins** group, you must define appropriate **IAM policies**.

### Example Policy Set:

```sql
Allow group OCI-Admins to manage all-resources in tenancy
```

Grants full resource management permissions (like the tenancy admin).

But OCI Admins also need **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** privileges, so they can manage users, groups, and policies.

### IAM Resource Types:

- `domains`
- `users`
- `groups`
- `dynamic-groups`
- `policies`
- `compartments`
- `identity-providers`
- `network-sources`
- `tag-defaults`
- `tag-namespaces`

### Example IAM Policy:

```sql
Allow group OCI-Admins to manage users in tenancy
Allow group OCI-Admins to manage groups in tenancy
Allow group OCI-Admins to manage policies in tenancy
Allow group OCI-Admins to manage compartments in tenancy
Allow group OCI-Admins to manage dynamic-groups in tenancy
Allow group OCI-Admins to manage tag-namespaces in tenancy
```
